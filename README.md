# GraphQL Prototype

A toy GraphQL project, mostly following the [Siler tutorial](https://siler.leocavalcante.dev/graphql). Has a simple, self contained docker setup for local play.

## Getting Started

Run `docker-compose` to launch the GraphQL service on http://localhost/.

```
$ docker-compose up
```

That's it, now you can run some queries. I use [GraphQL Playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground) to do that.
